        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a part time student at CSULB. Currently I am in the College of Engineering and I am a computer science major! I have been here for almost a year, and I am already almost finish with my first year of college. I started out coding when I was in a Junior in high school and I took an intro to Python class. Before you knew it, I took a major interest in coding and took on AP Computer Science in my Senior of high school. Ever since then, I have been trying to expand my knowledge in the computer science field by learning languages like Python, Java, C, C++, and Ruby. My dream is to one day to become a software engineering at a major company, while designing video games on my spare time. 


I am youngest child in my family being I have one older sister and one older brother. Both my brother and sister inspire as they both have degrees in the College of Engineering, and they are already living on their own. A little more about me is that I am super passionate about video games and photography. Whenever I get to stressed out about coding, video games and photography bring me peace of mind. </p>
